CHANGELOG
=========

Feb.2025: P.Sieg: Shift-K also asks for a filename to start autotyping. Files are located in subdir "type".
Shift-H = Hard Reset changed to Shift-N (New)

2.4.0 mtleblanc's contribution:
- Indirect X zero page addressing should always wrap and stay on zero page
- BRK should disable interrupts
- ADC in decimal mode should carry between nibbles based on adjusted,
  not original values.
- Writes of status register to the stack should always set M and should
  set B on BRK/PHP and ~B on IRQ/NMI
- Given the above, status register does not need to track M or B bits,
  removed from initialization.
